CC Library
==========

Introduction
------------

The CC library is a collection of data structures,
algorithms, and utility functions designed to accelerate C
development. It offers a wide range of tools for common
programming tasks, including memory management, data
manipulation, and mathematical operations.

* Robust Data Structures: Efficiently manage data with
  doubly linked lists (List), hash maps (Map), and flexible
  hash-based collections (Multimap).
* Reliable Synchronization: Coordinate concurrent tasks and
  protect shared resources using WorkQ and JobQ
  synchronization primitives.
* Essential Utilities: Simplify development with robust
  logging, flexible memory management, random number
  generation, and precise timestamping.
* Advanced Math Functions: Perform complex calculations with
  float operators, conversions, vector and matrix
  operations, quaternion operations, raycasting, clipping,
  and power-of-two calculations.
